UnityJS
=====

A very simple [single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) framework.

## Usage
Define each page in your HTML by encapsulating its content in a div that has `data-role="view"` as an attribute.

If you plan to separate each page into its own HTML file you will need to use a build tool like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to compile all your HTML into a single HTML file.

> _Note:_ There is no support for external html templates.

### Example
